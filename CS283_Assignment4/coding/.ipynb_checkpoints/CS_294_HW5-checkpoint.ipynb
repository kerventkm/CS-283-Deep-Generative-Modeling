    "In this homework, we are going to explore the [Glow model](https://openai.com/blog/glow/).\n",
    "It is a flow-based model, so before you start — make sure that you understand the corresponding lectures well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to do 3 things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [1 pts] train a Glow model on MNIST\n",
    "- [8 pts] implement a simple block-diagonal layer to hone our understanding of flow-based models\n",
    "- [1 pts] explore how reasonable the reversibility of Glow is\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also 2 bonus points:\n",
    "- [1 bonus pts] run Glow on Celeba 64x64\n",
    "- [1 bonus pts] do a simple ablation for the block-diagonal layer\n",
    "\n",
    "What you can and what you cannot do:\n",
    "- You are free to use whatever code/information you find online, but you **must specify the sources** (otherwise we'll consider that you copied some other student's work)\n",
    "- You are **not** allowed to put your solution online or share it with other students\n",
    "- You can change the training hyperparameters if you like\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this assignment you will need:\n",
    "- `pytorch3.6+`\n",
    "- `torch>=1.5`\n",
    "- `torchvision>=0.4.0`\n",
    "- `hydra>=1.0.4`\n",
    "- `tqdm`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `pillow` and other standard libraries\n",
    "- a GPU card (we used 2080 Ti to design this assignment)\n",
    "\n",
    "What you should submit:\n",
    "- A zip-archive named `FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME_CS294_HW5.zip` with this solved notebook and the corresponding images. You are not supposed to change `train.py` and `model.py`, but if you do — you must submit them as well. You will be deduced 0.5 points if your submission is not named properly.\n",
    "- **Very important**: your notebook must be reproducible. I.e. when one hits `Run All Cells` button on your submitted notebook — it should execute without runtime errors (the only exception is if only some libraries are not found) and provide the same results that you report.\n",
    "- Please, have mercy on us and do not use more than 11GB GPU memory since it might become a bit harder for us to evaluate your homework. You can use more compute for Celeba 64x64, but the main part can be done under 11 GB in a reasonable time.\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "For any questions/errors, please contact Ivan Skorokhodov in the `#cs294d` slack channel.\n",
